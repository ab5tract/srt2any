00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500


2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,150
Myriam: OK.

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,050
Hahn: Now, what's this...

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:14,700
Myriam: I’m gonna explain a little,
because I talked to David about it more than I did to you.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:23,850
So, Meg is going to make a book on Damaged Goods and her work,

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:37,400
and the book is going to consist of texts
that are more or less written by collaborators, artists,
and lots of interviews also.

7
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:48,050
They asked me to do something on Crash Landing,
actually the improvisation projects, so also Auf den Tisch.

8
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:56,200
It was an idea of Meg somehow to have a reunion,
with Christine and David,

9
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:09,450
because for most of the Crash Landings they were the three, say,
leading choreographers of Crash Landing.

10
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:16,400
Since Lisbon, since  Moscow
they have never really met the three of them.

11
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,500
So somehow Crash Landing is an end to their collaboration.

12
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,500
Somehow it marks even a series of endings,
and that was one of them.

13
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:35,850
So, the idea was that if they have a reunion and talk together
about the whole Crash Landing
in a very unedited way,

14
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:48,200
uninhibited, I would say,
to find out what it was and how they see its significance ten years later.

15
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:56,550
And I would do the reunion with them,
but I suggested that I wouldn’t speak with any of them,

16
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,600
with Meg, Christine nor David,

17
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:08,850
but that I would have like a round of interviews with the people
who were involved in some way or another.

18
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:15,800
That includes presenters, production managers, artists, musicians, audience.

19
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:27,050
And euh… I am going start actually my research,
because I need to have a research phase first, in October.

20
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,800
In that sense this conversation comes…

21
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,850
either it is a very good timing or either it is a very bad timing.

22
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:42,300
With a very good timing, I would mean, like it's a first exploration
in a more conversational way,

23
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:48,750
which I can then in October make a bit more profound,
when I really start researching.

24
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,100
So it could be like a teaser, an appetizer, a first…

25
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,250
opening the can actually... of worms.

26
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:09,900
Or it can be a bad timing if
if I feel that somehow I have not enough background information
to really trigger the right memory...

27
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,150
push the right memory buttons.

28
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,900
That's why it's good to the two of you
are here together, I feel.

29
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,350
David: Are there programs of any of them?

30
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,700
Myriam: Yes, well, there’s some videomaterial
although it's not so very well documented, Crash Landing.

31
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,350
David: Actually, of all things,
I wish I could just look at a program.

32
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,400
Just even to recreate musically who were the people in each one.

33
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,050
Hahn: Sometimes I even forget.

34
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,800
I was just talking about Vienna I guess with Meg
or somebody or maybe...

35
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,350
I forget who I was talking with.

36
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,800
I totally forgot about the Vienna musicians.

37
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,650
Hary De Wit, in Vienna, I remember very well.

38
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,100
But I do not remember a fourth,
if there was a fourth.

39
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,350
I don't even remember.

40
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,400
You see, I knew Harry De Wit beforehand.

41
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,150
He is a keyboardist and a percussionist, Dutch.

42
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,100
Hahn: Wasn’t there someone who played the saxophone or something?

43
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,050
Or guitar?

44
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,500
David : He also plays base, clarinet, and guitar and base

45
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,050
and tapdances.

46
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,600
He is just an all-round maniac,
god.

47
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,750
Can I do this? Leuven...

48
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,800
I can't spell them...

49
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:49,550
(David takes a piece of paper and a pen and starts writing down names ;
he is mapping the musical line up of each edition of Crash Landing,
starting with Leuven.)

50
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,700
Myriam: 1996.

51
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,050
Hahn: Ah, you see, already you remember... What do you do?

52
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,800
Ahh, kind of... I think...

53
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,850
Psychedelic underground.
(David points to the name of Music Transonic on the paper).
