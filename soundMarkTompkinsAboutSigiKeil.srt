1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
What is a failure

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,250
and how the failure becomes a good piece

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,200
I mean, it keeps revolving around what happened the first night

4
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:13,250
yes, let's go to the first night

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,000
because that for me is... that is a great piece

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,050
what happened was a great piece

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,500
and it didn't came from the stage
it came from the outside

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,250
and what happened to the context
when the eruption took place

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:38,300
Tell your witness story.
You're now a real witness.

10
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,550
where were you usually sitting when you were witnessing Crash Landing

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,300
on stage on the side

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,050
that night it was in a big sofa

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,800
I was sitting with Nadia Lauro

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,350
and euh...
we were watching basically

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,200
and were you visible to the audience?

16
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,750
yes.    yes.

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,600
so throughout you would be visible as someone in a sofa
watching... a piece

18
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,450
not to the whole
probably not the whole because it was quite of stage to the side

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,800
but at least half of the audience could see

20
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:23,050
and we weren't always there
and I wasn't always with Nadia

21
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,800
sometimes I was reall off stage

22
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,550
I just happened that at that time we were there

23
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,300
because it was in the way of working

24
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,050
there was kind of a...
there was a stage setting

25
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,800
with the square hole
over there (if I'm the audience)

26
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,050
on each side there were racks of clothes
that Nadia had proposed

27
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,700
she had gone through all the clothes of Théâtre de la Ville
the costume supply

28
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,450
and chose things that people could put on if they wanted

29
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,600
then there was the sofa
they could also go into the space or be not in the space

30
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,950
and there was the tree
that we used the first night

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,600
and euh... I don't remeber very well
what else there was on stage

32
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,550
and the music

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,100
ah there was Hahn

34
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,050
yes there were three musician places

35
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,900
with euh... Hahn and... I think
turntables

36
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,750
and what was his name...

37
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,650
David Linton

38
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,100
John Rose

39
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,700
Do you remember if you were announced in the program?

40
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,550
as a witness or as a participant?

41
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,300
as a witness
like this

42
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,150
whilst you're on stage as witness
do you perceive that as a role?

43
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,500
Sorry, what did you say?

44
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,450
You're a witness, but you're also on stage
in a sofa and... you know

45
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,700
You're really in the heat of the...
Does that become a role?

46
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,750
So it's part of the performance.

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,500
There is a moment I remember that I was sitting
with Nadia and she said

48
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,250
I feel so comfortable here
